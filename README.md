Robot Navigation and Localization based on Bug 1 and Bug 2 which can be calculated by Rodrigues formulas.
Bug 1: When encounter an obstacle, the robot will go around the obstacle and define a point which is closer to the target location.
Bug 2: The robot marks a straight line X from current position to the target location. When encounter an obstacle, it will go around the obstacle until it hits the line X and follow the straight line to the target location again.
